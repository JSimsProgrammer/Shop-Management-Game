So for Person Type, I will have lots of different types. There will be personality style sliders on their character. 
Maybe playesr can see their scores, maybe not. Don't sure. But I think these traits will also be store traits. I need to think
of how that loop will work. But then, once your score has a certain high enough score, it will increase the chance of that type of person showing,
and people of that type like the store more. It will also increase the chance of events of that type happening. As far as how it needs to be structured,
it will need to be a weighted ratio. I'm gonna write some shit psuedocode below to try to explain it:
	
	#My example traits are Weird, Poltical, and Business
	
	func EventType(weird_weight, political_weight, business_weight):
